# /etc/pam.d/ngircd

# You have to adjust this configuration to your local setup and needs. Keep in
# mind that all PAM modules are run with the privileges of the user account the
# ngIRCd daemon runs as ("irc" by default, not root!), so you can't use PAM
# modules requiring root privileges (like pam_unix, for example)!

# Log and deny all connections to ngIRCd:
auth required pam_warn.so
auth required pam_deny.so
